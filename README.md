### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am SebastiÃ¡n, before becoming a full-stack developer, I studied engineering for 4 years and worked as a digital marketing specialist building websites for 10 years, during that time I was able to lead and manage many teams and accounts and it was the most rewarding challenge.

Iâ€™m currently working as Code Reviewer at Microverse inc (San Francisco, California) and developing projects with HTML, SASS, JavaScript, React.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and MySQL with coding partners from around the world, 100% remotely, and meeting every deadline with no delays. It has been more than a thousand hours of coding with professional standards and reviewers.
