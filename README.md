### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am SebastiÃ¡n, before becoming a full-stack developer, I studied engineering for 4 years and worked as a digital marketing specialist building websites for 10 years, during that time I was able to lead and manage many teams and accounts and it was the most rewarding challenge.

Iâ€™m currently studying and developing projects with HTML, SASS, and JavaScript with coding partners from around the world, 100% remotely, and meeting every deadline with no delays. It has been hundreds of hours coding with professional standards and reviewers.

Iâ€™m looking for a backend developer position to bring my teamwork experience to your company and begin a successful journey. Let me know when we can have a 15 minutes call to answer any questions you have.
